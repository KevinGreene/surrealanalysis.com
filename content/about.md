I'm a full stack software engineer, mathematician, and game enthusiast.

Over the past few years I've worked on a large variety of things, with a focus on Groovy, Elasticsearch, Java (with Spring), and Clojure. I am constantly looking to expand my horizons with software development, and I'm currently using Elixir for hobby projects. I love projects that try to enable others to make better decisions algorithmically.
