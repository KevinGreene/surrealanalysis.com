I'm a full stack software engineer, mathematician, and game enthusiast.

Over the past few years I've worked on a large variety of things, with a focus on Groovy, Elasticsearch, Java (with Spring), and Clojure. For data, I've mainly worked with Elasticsearch, PostreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, Redis, and RabbitMQ, but I'm always open to new ways to organize and explore data.

I am constantly looking to expand my horizons with software development, and I'm currently using Elixir for hobby projects.

I love projects that try to enable others to make better decisions algorithmically.

My free time is mainly filled with working on side technical projects, doing non-profit technical work, organizing meetups, and playing and designing games.
